## Updates/Reflection

- My initial deadline was clearly too optimistic. During the Summer, I prioritized visiting with family and friends since I would have to leave in early August, and not see many of them until Christmas break. I have always prioritized my family and friends over my career, and even though it may set me back in terms of financial gain, I can't say I regret it. Now August was reserved for moving into a new place and getting resettled, but once September rolled around, I knew it was time to return. Reading my deadline and especially the purpose I wrote down, I got quite discouraged and wondered, "_Am_ I someone who 'takes initiative and can effectively plan and execute a project under time constraints'"? Well, maybe I'm not there yet, but I need to stop beating myself up and just get back to it. I'm going to shoot for having this done by November.
